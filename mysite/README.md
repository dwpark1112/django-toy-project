## What
This is my toy project to get familiar with Python and Django framework.

I'm already learning Java's Spring framework, but I do not think it's a good idea to develop a web project. I thought that using django framework would be able to develop web project more efficiently.

It's just that's all.

## History
#### commit #10 User authentication in Django
> **['django.contrib.auth'](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/auth/)** contains the core of the authentication framework, and its default models.

I was able to create login/logout/register/change password functions quite comfortably.
